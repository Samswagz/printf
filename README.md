# printf
This repository is for the creation of a custom printf project
This project contains a custom printf function that is modelled to perform the parts of the standard print.
This project is handled by myself Ile Samuel and my partner Kevin Muzonda;
while creating this custom function we will make it take the following:
1. Argument
2. Format specifiers and processing
3. Conversion of and formating of arguments with respect to format specifiers
4. Output generation
5. Error handling
6. Printing of special characters
7. Memory management
