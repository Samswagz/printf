# printf
This repository is for the creation of a custom printf project
This project contains a custom printf function that is modelled to perform the parts of the standard print.
This project is handled by myself Ile Samuel and my partner Kevin Muzonda;
while creating this custom function we will make it take the following:
 * Argument
 * Format specifiers and processing
 * Conversion of and formating of arguments with respect to format specifiers
 * Output generation
 * Error handling
 * Printing of special characters
 * Memory management
